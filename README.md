**Predict Sex Patterns in ADHD â€“ WiDS Datathon 2025**

---

## 1. Objective  
Predict the **sex (Male/Female)** of individuals in ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) data by applying **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **feature engineering**, and **machine learning models**.

---

## 2. Team Members  
- The team has **4 members**:
  - **3 members**: Responsible for EDA & Feature Engineering  
  - **1 member**: Responsible for Model Fine-Tuning

## 3. Repository Structure  

- `Categorical_ADHD_EDA.ipynb`  
  â†’ Notebook for exploring categorical variables, analyzing distributions, checking missing values, and visualizing feature relationships.  

- `Data preprocessing_FE_official.ipynb`  
  â†’ Data preprocessing: handling missing values, normalization, categorical encoding, scaling, and creating new features to improve model performance.  

- `finetune.ipynb`  
  â†’ Fine-tuning machine learning models: experimenting with algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM, RandomForest, or deep learning), optimizing hyperparameters, and selecting the best-performing model.  

- `README.md`  
  â†’ This project documentation.

## 4. Workflow  

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Inspect data characteristics, perform statistical analysis, and handle missing values.  
   - Visualize data to understand trends and group differences.  

2. **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**  
   - Normalize and encode data.  
   - Create new features (feature crosses, interactions, aggregations).  
   - Select the optimal feature set for modeling.  

3. **Model Fine-Tuning**  
   - Apply multiple ML algorithms.  
   - Use Grid Search / Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning.  
   - Evaluate performance using relevant metrics (e.g., ROC-AUC, F1-score).

## 5. Results  
- Team **Naomi** achieved **Top 30 worldwide** in the **WiDS Datathon 2025** ðŸŽ‰  
- This accomplishment reflects the effective combination of data analysis, feature engineering techniques, and fine-tuning strategies.
